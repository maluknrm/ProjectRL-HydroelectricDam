# Reinforcement Learning Project - Group 3

Implementation of the three algorithms that were conducted for the project. The main file runs the quantiles baseline algorithm, since it had the highest validation return. The implementation of the Double-Deep Q-Learning and the Tabular Q-Learning can be found in the files run_ddq.py and run_tab_q.py.

## Running the Main file
To run the main file call the following prompt with the file path.

```{objectives}
- python main.py -P PATH
```
For example,

```{objectives}
- python main.py -P validate.xlsx
```
